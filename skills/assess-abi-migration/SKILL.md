# Assess ABI Migration

Inspect a third-party PyTorch extension repo (e.g., flash-attention, vllm, a custom CUDA op library) and determine:

1. Whether the project is migrateable to the stable ABI for the PyTorch version installed.
2. What concrete steps are required, in dependency order.
3. Where the stable ABI has **missing coverage** for this project — APIs the project uses that have no `torch::stable` or `torch::headeronly` equivalent yet.

This skill does not modify code. It produces a machine-readable plan that `orchestrate-stable-abi-migration` consumes.

## Prerequisites

- The user's extension repo (the migration target) is checked out locally.
- PyTorch 2.10+ is installed in the active environment (this is the `build_torch_version`):
  ```bash
  python3 -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__)"
  ```
  If below 2.10, stop and tell the user to upgrade — the stable ABI surface is much more complete in 2.10+.

## Inputs

- `repo_root`: absolute path to the extension repo root.

- `build_torch_version`: the PyTorch version the extension will be **compiled against**. Determines which headers are present during the build and which symbols the assess step can grep for. **Should match the currently installed torch** (`python3 -c 'import torch; print(torch.__version__)'`). If not provided, default to the installed version and confirm with the user, e.g.:

  > "I'll assess against the installed torch `<x.y.z>` as the build-time version. Use a different version? (If so, install it in the active env first — the assess step greps real headers.)"

  Constraint: must equal the installed torch version. If they differ, stop and ask the user to either install the requested version or accept the installed one.

- `target_torch_version`: the **minimum runtime** PyTorch version the resulting wheel should support — gets encoded as `TORCH_TARGET_VERSION` in the build. Lower = wider compatibility (one wheel covers more torch releases); higher = more stable APIs available. **If not provided, ask** before continuing:

  > "What's the lowest PyTorch version you want this wheel to support at runtime? Common answers: `2.10` (widest), `2.11` (standard), or `<build_torch_version>` (match the build, narrowest support window). This becomes `TORCH_TARGET_VERSION` and determines what counts as a coverage gap."

  Constraints:
  - ≥ 2.9 (older versions don't have a usable stable surface).
  - ≤ `build_torch_version` (can't promise runtime support for a torch newer than what we compiled against).

### Why two versions

- The **build** version determines what's available in headers right now, on this machine, for the migration to use.
- The **target** version determines what's available in headers on **every other user's machine** when they install the resulting wheel. It's the lowest common denominator the binary must work with at runtime.

A coverage gap is "API exists in build, doesn't exist at target" — those are APIs you literally cannot use even though they're sitting in the headers, because the wheel must also run on older torch installations. Step 4 checks for this by greping the build headers and then verifying each found symbol's `#if TORCH_FEATURE_VERSION >= TORCH_VERSION_X_Y_0` guard against the target.

## Discovery steps

### 1. Identify the build system

Look for, in priority order:
- `setup.py` with `CUDAExtension` / `CppExtension` imported from `torch.utils`.
- `CMakeLists.txt` referencing `Torch` / `find_package(Torch)`.
- `pyproject.toml` with a build backend.

Record which is present.

### 2. Find C++/CUDA source files in scope

Ignore test files and any files (e.g., in an `experimental` directory) that are not part of the shipped library. Look for files matching `*.cpp`, `*.cc`, `*.cu`, `*.cuh`, usually in a `csrc` directory, that include any of the following headers:
- `<torch/extension.h>`
- `<ATen/...>`
- `<c10/...>`
- `<torch/library.h>`
- `<pybind11/...>`

#### 2a. Vendored / FetchContent / submodule sources are in scope if compiled into the shipped wheel

A "vendored" source is any file from an external project (git submodule, CMake `FetchContent`, vendored copy under `third_party/`, `csrc/external/`, etc.) that the build system **compiles into the shipped shared library**. From the resulting `.so`'s perspective, vendored code is indistinguishable from first-party code — both contribute symbols and both must be ABI-stable.

To find them, read the build files (`CMakeLists.txt`, `setup.py`, sub-CMakeLists includes) and look for:
- CMake variables resolved to `${repo-foo_SOURCE_DIR}/.../*.cu` listed in `SOURCES` / `add_library(...)` / `Python_add_library(...)`.
- `file(GLOB ... ${repo-foo_SOURCE_DIR}/...)` patterns that pick up many vendored files at once.
- `add_subdirectory(${repo-foo_SOURCE_DIR} ...)` that builds the vendored project as a static lib linked into the wheel.
- `setup.py` extensions whose `sources=[...]` list includes paths outside `csrc/`.

For each vendored source compiled into the wheel:
- If the files are checked out locally (e.g. `build/_deps/repo-foo-src/...` exists, or under `third_party/`), grep them the same way as first-party sources for the concerns in Step 3 and the gaps in Step 4. Add them to the `files` list with a `vendored: true` marker and the upstream repo URL + pinned commit/tag.
- **If they are not checked out locally** (`build/_deps/` empty, no `third_party/` copy) and you cannot fetch them (no network access to GitHub, no permission to run `cmake configure` to populate `_deps`), surface this as a **blocker** of type `vendored-source-unfetched`. Record the file list (with `${repo-foo}` placeholders), the upstream repo+tag from `FetchContent_Declare`, and the reason. Do NOT silently drop them — the wheel cannot ship as ABI-stable until they are migrated too.

Remediation options to suggest with each `vendored-source-unfetched` blocker:
1. Re-run the assess skill on a host with network access after `cmake -S . -B build` populates `build/_deps/`.
2. Upstream the migration via PRs to the vendored project (and bump the `GIT_TAG` in `FetchContent_Declare` afterwards).
3. Fork-and-patch locally under `csrc/third_party/` with the migration applied, replacing the `FetchContent_Declare` URL.

**Things that are NOT in scope even if vendored:**
- Header-only libraries (e.g. cutlass, fmt) — no compiled `.cu`/`.cpp` from them; they only affect compile time, not the resulting symbol table.
- Static libs that don't call libtorch (e.g. a vendored NCCL/mscclpp built via `add_subdirectory`). The static lib gets linked into the wheel but its own source doesn't touch the unstable libtorch ABI. **Verify** by checking the vendored project's source for `torch::`/`at::`/`c10::` — if absent, it's fine; if present, it's in scope after all.
- Python-only artifacts installed via CMake `install(DIRECTORY ...)` (e.g. a vendored Triton kernel directory). No C++ compilation, no migration.

#### 2b. Cross-backend / multi-wheel projects

Many projects ship multiple wheels from the same source tree — typically a CUDA wheel plus alternate-accelerator wheels (CPU, ROCm, MUSA/Moore Threads, XPU, Metal). Look for sibling build files like `pyproject_cpu.toml`, `pyproject_rocm.toml`, `pyproject_musa.toml`, `setup_metal.py`, or `csrc/cpu/CMakeLists.txt`. Each one usually produces a separately-named wheel (e.g. `sglang-kernel-cpu`).

For each alternate wheel:
- Note its `[build-system].requires` torch pin (it may differ from the main CUDA wheel's pin — e.g. CPU pinned to `torch==2.9.0` while CUDA uses `>=2.8.0`).
- Identify the **headers and source files it shares** with the in-scope wheel. Look for:
  - `target_include_directories(... ../../include)` or equivalent — the alt-wheel sees the same shared header files.
  - Headers like `sgl_kernel_ops.h` that declare function signatures with `at::Tensor`/`TORCH_CHECK`/`c10::optional` and are `#include`d by both the in-scope binder (`common_extension.cc`) and the alt-arch binders (`common_extension_musa.cc`, `common_extension_rocm.cc`).
  - Shared utility headers (`utils.h`, `scalar_type.hpp`).
- Surface the sharing as a **`shared-header-cross-backend` blocker** for the in-scope wheel if a naive migration would force the alt-wheels to move too. Migrating a shared header's `at::Tensor` to `torch::stable::Tensor` cascades into every `#include`r.

Remediation options to suggest with each `shared-header-cross-backend` blocker:
- **Plan A — migrate all wheels together.** Includes alt-arch in the same PR. Safest semantics, biggest scope.
- **Plan B (usually preferred) — split the shared header per-backend.** Create `..._unstable.h` (used by alt-arch backends staying on libtorch) and `..._stable.h` (used by the migrated wheel). Lets the in-scope wheel ship ABI-stable while alt-arches catch up.
- **Plan C — conditionalize the shared header on a macro** like `#ifdef PROJECT_USE_STABLE_ABI`. Lightest touch but increases header complexity.

Record the cross-backend findings in a top-level `cross_backend_analysis` section of the plan JSON: for each alt-wheel, list its torch pin, the headers it shares with the in-scope wheel, whether it's in scope for *this* run, and a one-line note about its migration prospects (e.g. "MUSA depends on torch_musa fork's stable-ABI support — gates this wheel"). This lets the user decide whether to migrate the wheels in one shot or as a sequence.`

### 3. Detect migration concerns per file

For each source file, record which of the following apply (these drive sub-skill dispatch):

| Concern | Sub-skill | Detection signal |
|---|---|---|
| Pybind bindings | `pybind-to-torch-library` | `PYBIND11_MODULE`, `m.def("name", ...)` outside `TORCH_LIBRARY`, `<pybind11/...>` includes |
| C++ meta functions | `migrate-meta-fns-to-python` | `TORCH_LIBRARY_IMPL(..., Meta, m)`, registrations with dispatch key `Meta` |
| C++ autograd impls | `migrate-autograd-fns-to-python` | `TORCH_LIBRARY_IMPL(..., Autograd, m)` / `..., AutogradCUDA, m)`, C++ `torch::autograd::Function` subclasses registered for the op |
| Unstable API usage | `migrate-to-stable-apis` | Any `at::Tensor`, `TORCH_CHECK`, `c10::cuda::CUDAGuard`, `at::empty`, `TORCH_LIBRARY_IMPL`, etc. |

The `scaffold-stable-target` subskill is dispatched only for **incremental** migrations. See Step 7 for the cadence decision; one-shot migrations skip it and `migrate-to-stable-apis` converts the existing extension in place.

### 4. Detect stable-ABI coverage gaps

Coverage gaps are APIs the project uses that have **no equivalent in the installed PyTorch's stable surface**. The stable surface changes between PyTorch releases, so this check must be against the actually-installed `torch`, not a hardcoded list.

**Resolve the stable headers directory:**

```bash
TORCH_STABLE_DIR=$(python3 -c "
import os, torch
print(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(torch.__file__), 'include', 'torch', 'csrc', 'stable'))
")
ls "$TORCH_STABLE_DIR"
# Expected: ops.h, tensor.h, library.h, device.h, accelerator.h, c/, ...
```

Also locate `torch/headeronly/`:

```bash
TORCH_HO_DIR=$(python3 -c "
import os, torch
print(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(torch.__file__), 'include', 'torch', 'headeronly'))
")
```

**For each candidate gap**, grep the stable headers for the expected replacement symbol. Examples:

| Unstable API in user code | Expected stable symbol | Verification |
|---|---|---|
| `at::empty_strided(...)` | `new_empty_strided` or `empty_strided` | `grep -E 'new_empty_strided\|^.*empty_strided\b' "$TORCH_STABLE_DIR"/*.h "$TORCH_STABLE_DIR"/c/*.h` |
| `tensor.layout() == at::Layout::Strided` | `Layout` enum or a `layout()` method on `torch::stable::Tensor` | `grep -E 'enum.*Layout\|::Layout\b\|::layout\(' "$TORCH_HO_DIR"/**/*.h "$TORCH_STABLE_DIR"/*.h` |
| `at::native::<op>` | `<op>` in `ops.h` | `grep -E '\b<op>\b' "$TORCH_STABLE_DIR"/ops.h` |
| `at::parallel_for(...)` | `torch::stable::parallel_for` in `ops.h` (backed by `torch_parallel_for` C shim) | `grep -n 'parallel_for' "$TORCH_STABLE_DIR"/ops.h "$TORCH_STABLE_DIR"/c/shim.h` |
| `at::TensorIterator` | n/a — no current stable equivalent | confirm absence: `grep -i tensoriterator "$TORCH_STABLE_DIR"/*.h "$TORCH_HO_DIR"/**/*.h` |
| `torch::autograd::Function` | n/a in C++ — move to Python | not a header check; route to `migrate-autograd-fns-to-python` instead |

> **Important:** This table is illustrative and reflects the stable surface at the time of writing. The stable ABI is actively growing — never trust this table over the actual `grep` against the installed headers. Symbols that were "absent" in one PyTorch release often appear in the next.

A symbol is **available at build** if it's declared in any header under `$TORCH_STABLE_DIR` or `$TORCH_HO_DIR`. The C shims under `$TORCH_STABLE_DIR/c/` and `<torch_include>/torch/csrc/inductor/aoti_torch/c/` also count.

### Resolving the minimum target version for each symbol

Two cases, each handled differently:

**Case 1: C shim functions** (anything declared in `torch/csrc/stable/c/shim.h` or `torch/csrc/inductor/aoti_torch/c/*.h`). Use the authoritative version map:

```
torch/csrc/stable/c/shim_function_versions.txt
```

Format: one `function_name: TORCH_VERSION_X_Y_Z` line per shim. Per the file's own header: **"If a function is not in this file, it was available before 2.10.0."** Since our minimum supported target is 2.9, that means unlisted = available at every target we care about.

Lookup logic for a C shim symbol `<sym>`:
- Listed as `<sym>: TORCH_VERSION_X_Y_Z` → minimum version is `X.Y.Z`.
- Not listed → available at all supported targets (treat as no version constraint).

The file does **not** ship in the installed torch's `include/` tree, so to access the file:
- If `<pytorch_src>/torch/csrc/stable/c/shim_function_versions.txt` is available locally, read it directly.
- Otherwise fetch from GitHub pinned to the build torch's release tag:
  `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pytorch/pytorch/v<build_torch_version>/torch/csrc/stable/c/shim_function_versions.txt`

**Case 2: C++ wrappers** (anything in `torch/csrc/stable/*.h` outside `c/`, or `torch/headeronly/`). No authoritative version map; use grep around the symbol declaration as an estimate:

```bash
grep -B 5 -A 2 "<symbol>" "$TORCH_STABLE_DIR"/*.h
# Look for the enclosing `#if TORCH_FEATURE_VERSION >= TORCH_VERSION_X_Y_Z`
```

Three outcomes:

- **Clear guard found** with `X.Y.Z > target_torch_version` → coverage gap; `min_target_to_close: "X.Y.Z"`.
- **Clear guard found** with `X.Y.Z ≤ target_torch_version` → available at target; not a gap.
- **No guard found, or guards are nested/combined and grep is ambiguous** → cannot determine the minimum version with certainty. Default to:
  - Available at `build_torch_version` (it's in the build headers, so the build works).
  - "Maybe supported" at older targets. Record `min_target_to_close: "<build_torch_version>"` with `reason: "version guard inconclusive; available at build, may not be at older runtimes"`. Surface in chat summary so the user can spot-check or accept the conservative answer.

The grep approach is rough — it can miss nested `#if`s, `||`/`&&` combinations, and macro indirection. For C shims that's not a problem (the txt file is authoritative). For C++ wrappers, accept some false-positive gaps as the price of a fast assess; the user can override via the `reason` field or run `migrate-to-stable-apis` and let the build confirm.

#### For each gap, evaluate whether bumping the target would close it

Three categories:

1. **Gap closeable by raising target.** Symbol exists in build headers under a `TORCH_FEATURE_VERSION` guard with `X.Y.Z > target_torch_version`. Bumping target to `X.Y.Z` closes the gap. Record `min_target_to_close: "X.Y.Z"`.

2. **Gap not closeable with current offering.** Symbol is absent from build headers for the installed torch. Options to try a documented workaround, rerunning the skill on a newer torch version, or filing an issue for the API to be added. Record `min_target_to_close: null` with a `reason` field, e.g., `"absent from torch::stable through build version <build_torch_version>"`.

3. **Gap structural, no stable equivalent expected.** E.g., `at::TensorIterator`, `torch::autograd::Function` — these are libtorch-internal designs without a planned stable surface (autograd specifically moves to Python via `migrate-autograd-fns-to-python`). Record `min_target_to_close: "n/a"` with `reason: "no planned stable equivalent"`. Be conservative classifying things here — if you're not sure whether an API is structurally absent vs. just not added yet, prefer category 2 (`null` with a `reason`).

Aggregate the closeable gaps for the chat summary. If raising the target by one minor version would close N of M gaps, surface that as actionable guidance: the user can decide whether the narrower runtime support window is worth shedding those workarounds.

**Heuristic for naming.** Most legacy ATen ops have a same-named stable counterpart in `torch::stable::`. So for `at::<op>(...)`, the first thing to check is `grep -E '\b<op>\b' "$TORCH_STABLE_DIR/ops.h"`. If that fails, also try variants prefixed with `new_` (PyTorch's convention for factory ops that take a reference tensor — `new_empty`, `new_zeros`).

**Record the target PyTorch version with each gap.** Use `target_torch_version` from the skill's inputs (not the installed version, if they differ). Future readers need to know "this gap was true at the target the assessment was scoped to" — the same API may be added in a later release that the user might be willing to raise the target to.

For each gap found, record in the plan: file, line, old API, the expected stable symbol that was checked for, the torch version checked against, suggested workaround if one is documented (see [api-mapping.md § Strided Tensors](../migrate-to-stable-apis/references/api-mapping.md) and [common-issues.md](../migrate-to-stable-apis/references/common-issues.md)), or `BLOCKED` if no workaround.

The plan's `coverage_gaps` entry should look like:

```json
{
  "path": "src/bar.cpp",
  "line": 142,
  "old_api": "at::empty_strided",
  "checked_symbol": "torch::stable::new_empty_strided",
  "checked_against_target_version": "2.11",
  "min_target_to_close": "2.13",   // or null / "n/a" — see Step 4 categories above
  "reason": null,                  // populated when min_target_to_close is null or "n/a"
  "workaround": "new_empty + transpose",
  "blocked": false
}
```

### 5. Capture build flags

Note whether the project already uses:
- `-DUSE_CUDA` (needed for `aoti_torch_get_current_cuda_stream`).
- `-DTORCH_TARGET_VERSION=...` (pins the target PyTorch version and bans unstable headers).
- `-DPy_LIMITED_API=0x...` (enables single-wheel-across-Python-versions). Also check `py_limited_api=True` in `cpp_extension.*Extension(...)` and `options={"bdist_wheel": {"py_limited_api": "..."}}` in `setup()`.

### 6. Detect existing Python fake/meta registrations

Grep for `@torch.library.register_fake(` and `torch.library.impl(..., "Meta")`. Record any ops that **already** have a Python fake — these don't need `migrate-meta-fns-to-python` even if a corresponding C++ Meta impl exists (the C++ one becomes redundant and gets deleted).

### 7. Decide migration cadence → whether to include `scaffold-stable-target`

Two valid shapes:

- **Incremental** (run `scaffold-stable-target`). A parallel stable `ext_modules` entry sits alongside the legacy one and grows file-by-file. The legacy target keeps building and serving un-migrated ops throughout. Best when the migration will land over multiple commits/PRs, or when CI gating requires a green tree between every file change.
- **One-shot** (skip `scaffold-stable-target`). `migrate-to-stable-apis` converts the single existing extension in place: adds `TORCH_TARGET_VERSION` to its flags, rewrites every in-scope file's APIs + registration macros, and the project ships the stable wheel directly. Best when the migration is small enough to validate as a single change — typically only a handful of translation units.

The threshold isn't strict. Use the count from Step 2 as a starting heuristic — roughly < ~5 TUs leans one-shot, more leans incremental — but the real question is "will the user land this as one change or many?"

**Ask the user before recording the decision:**

> "Found `<N>` translation units to migrate. Do you want to land this as: (a) one-shot — convert the existing extension in place, single PR; or (b) incremental — set up a parallel stable target and migrate file-by-file across multiple PRs, with the legacy target staying green throughout? Recommendation for `<N>` files: `<one-shot | incremental>`."

Record the choice. If **incremental**, include `scaffold-stable-target` in `dispatch_order` (before `migrate-to-stable-apis`). If **one-shot**, omit it. Save the user's choice and reasoning so re-runs don't re-prompt.

### 8. Detect test setup

Look for `pytest.ini`, `tests/`, `test_*.py`, `pyproject.toml`'s `[tool.pytest.ini_options]`, or a `Makefile` test target. Record the `test_cmd`. Sometimes testing the whole library is too expansive, in that case identify a few relevant smoke tests. If no tests exist at all, flag that as a `blocker` — a migration without a baseline test signal is too risky to auto-execute.

### Background: versioned shims (for explaining coverage gaps)

When this skill flags a "coverage gap," the underlying mechanic is usually shim versioning. The C shims in `torch/csrc/inductor/aoti_torch/c/shim.h` (and the wrappers in `torch/csrc/stable/`) are guarded:

```cpp
#if TORCH_FEATURE_VERSION >= TORCH_VERSION_2_11_0
inline torch::stable::Tensor from_blob(...) { ... }
#endif
```

So an API can simultaneously "exist in PyTorch" and "not be available at this `TORCH_TARGET_VERSION`." When reporting a gap, mention which torch version first exposed the missing API if you can determine it — that lets the user weigh raising `TORCH_TARGET_VERSION` against keeping wider compatibility.

The C-shim APIs (under `torch/csrc/inductor/aoti_torch/c/` and `torch/csrc/stable/c/`) carry a **minimum 2-year backward-compatibility window** from the release that introduced them. The higher-level wrappers in `torch/csrc/stable/` and `torch/headeronly/` follow PyTorch's standard FC/BC policy. Cite this when users ask "how long will this binary keep working?"

### Chat summary

Print a short markdown summary to the user:

- Build torch version: `<build_torch_version>` (must match installed).
- Target torch version (`TORCH_TARGET_VERSION`): `<target_torch_version>`. Resulting wheel will require this version or newer at runtime.
- Migrateable: yes / yes-with-workarounds / no (with reason).
- Files in scope: count (broken down: first-party / vendored-fetched / vendored-unfetched).
- Cross-backend wheel summary (if alt-arch wheels exist): one bullet per alt-wheel with torch pin + shared headers + the chosen Plan A/B/C.
- Sub-skills that are recommended (in order).
- Coverage gaps requiring workarounds, with closure analysis:
  - "Bumping target to 2.12 would close 1 of 5 gaps."
  - "Bumping target to 2.13 would close 4 of 5 gaps."
  - "1 gap is structural (`at::TensorIterator`) and won't close at any runtime version."
  This lets the user weigh "narrower runtime support" against "fewer workarounds to write."
- Hard blockers, if any.
